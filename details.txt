A police officer fatally shot a pet dog in a Massachusetts town after mistaking it for a wild animal, sparking outrage from the animal’s owner in what authorities are calling an unfortunate mistake.

The shooting occurred on Tuesday after police received a report of a large, unidentified animal in a residential backyard, said Timothy Labrie, chief of police in Northbridge, Massachusetts. The responding officer entered the wooded area near the property, saw what appeared to be a large, menacing wild animal, and discharged their firearm, Labrie said.

Upon closer inspection, the officer discovered the animal was a Great Dane named Juno, wearing a collar, Labrie said. Authorities then located the dog’s owner.

The dog’s owner, Kirk Rumford of Northbridge, said Juno was just shy of two years old. Rumford expressed frustration, stating non-lethal methods could have been used to assess the situation. He also argued that Juno didn’t resemble a wild animal.

“My dog was massive, yes, but majestic and gentle,” Rumford said. “It’s heartbreaking to think anyone could mistake him for something dangerous. A Great Dane doesn’t look like anything we have roaming wild around here.”

Rumford shared that he has received support from the community and hopes the incident will spark changes in handling similar situations. He described Juno as “a gentle giant” who was known for his playful and affectionate demeanor, particularly with children and smaller animals.

Labrie defended the officer’s actions, citing the challenging circumstances and the potential danger of the unknown animal. The officer will not face disciplinary action, Labrie said, adding that dog owners should take precautions to prevent such incidents.

“We urge residents to ensure their pets are secure at all times,” Labrie said. “Fenced yards, supervision, and visible identification like bright collars can help prevent mix-ups. If your dog is particularly large or tends to wander, it’s especially important to take these measures.”

The shooting comes amid an increase in reported encounters with wildlife across Massachusetts. In some areas, residents have expressed concerns about the growing presence of coyotes and other large animals near their homes. The town of Nahant recently contracted with federal authorities to manage coyote populations after several incidents involving pets.

Research into wildlife interactions suggests these trends may persist. Remington Moll, an assistant professor of natural resources at the University of New Hampshire, said hunting or removing certain wild species can sometimes lead to increased population growth due to changes in reproduction and migration patterns.

“Efforts to manage populations of large predators, like coyotes, can sometimes have unintended consequences,” Moll said. “Understanding these dynamics is key to creating effective solutions.”

Northbridge, a town of about 16,000 people located 43 miles west of Boston, has seen its share of wildlife sightings, Labrie said. The officer involved in the shooting is a seasoned professional who has handled numerous cases involving wild animals, Labrie added.

“Interactions with wildlife have definitely increased in recent years,” Labrie said. “It’s a tough challenge, and we’re doing everything we can to keep residents and their pets safe.”
